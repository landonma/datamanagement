## Data Management Implementation Plan


**_[Instructions in italics and bold. Remove them from the final document.
The material in this document may be integrated into a data management plan or used as a stand-alone agreement. There may be some overlap between the Internal Data Sharing Plan and the Data Management Plan. Remove or add text in this document as necessary so that this document is  ]_**

Rationale: This data sharing plan contains the expectations that will govern internal data sharing during the duration of the project. By internal data sharing we understand the sharing of datasets generated or compiled during a project among the members of the project while the project is ongoing.

### Data Management


Rationale: bad data management practices increase the chances of conflict among the members of a research project. All projects should have a data management plan, regardless of the size of the project, and regardless of the funding source of the project.


##### 1) **_[Project Name]_**


##### 2) Data Management Plan (DMP)
The data management plan for the project can be found **_[complete]_**

##### 3) Data Description
**_[if there are datasets that will be managed differently with respect to internal data sharing, describe them here so that we can refer to them throughout this document. Each section of this document should refer to each of the dataset groups outlined below. Feel free to refer to the DMP for a description of the dataset groups if that makes sense.]_**

------------------------------------
### Section 2
### Acknowledgment of Data Use


Rationale: Most of the data management responsibilities outlined in the final section require a lot of time and effort. Often, datasets are shared within members of the same project and the use of these datasets improves or makes possible scholarly outcomes  such as publications of articles, book chapters, presentations in conferences, proceedings, etc. It is necessary to have a common understanding on how to acknowledge the role of data managers, data creators, data analysts in the research process. These roles may not be appropriate as manuscript authors, but there are many other options. Acknowledging these roles is not a legal matter (no law requires it), but it is an ethical one. Responsible conduct of research involves acknowledging other people’s roles in managing data. Acknowledging the roles may also have an impact of the careers of researchers involved.    


**_[Decide what are the procedures that you will follow to acknowledge data management roles, and if there are any preferred methods. This template lists the options in order: options that follow best practices are noted at the beginning, while practices that we discourage are noted at the end. We use here “data management” as a general term, but consider changing it for more specific roles. For example, you may want to consider offering co-authorship to the researchers involved in data collection and data quality control as authors in data publications, and adding the researchers involved in instrumentation maintenance in the acknowledgements]_**


All members of the Project involved in roles related to data management will be acknowledged in some way. Specifically:



- Members of the Project that were involved in data management **_[change to a more specific role]_** will be offered co-authorship to papers that make use of their data. Co-authorship will require participation in the interpretation of the data, writing, or critical review of the manuscript, approval of the final manuscript. **_[if the group defines authorship using a specific set of criteria, include a link to these criteria here. A few examples of current definitions of authorship can be found in https://publicationethics.org/resources/discussion-documents/what-constitutes-authorship-june-2014]_**. The offer for co-authorship may be accepted or declined.


- Datasets will be published separately from the research in a repository or as an article in a data journal **_[change if there are more discipline specific options]_**. Members of the Project with a significant data management contribution will be listed as co-authors in the data publication. Every member of the Project that makes use of the published datasets will cite the dataset and list it in the reference list in their publications.  



- When possible, publications will be made in journals that use the CRediT authorship taxonomy (http://docs.casrai.org/CRediT) or similar. The roles of each of the members of the Project involved in data management will be documented using the appropriate roles.  



### Section 3
### Workflows


Rationale: setting expectations about how and when datasets will be shared internally will minimize conflict during the project.



- Datasets will be shared internally             **_[specify when researchers are expected to share their datasets. Some examples: as soon as possible after the data is collected/at the end of the sampling season/6 months after it is collected/on January of each year/when a researcher of the Project requests it ]_**.

- Datasets will be shared internally with         **_[who? Some examples: all the members of the team/members of the team approved by the IRB/the data manager of the project/the researcher who requested the dataset]_**.

- Datasets will be shared internally in                   format **_[is there an expected format? For example excel, or csv, or spss, or…]_**.

- Datasets will be shared internally                 **_[at which quality level? For example: after a quality control level has been assigned to each point following the schema in X / after following the protocol X for quality control/at any quality control level, as long as the documentation clarifies the quality control procedures that have been followed /only if all the data points have been subject to the whole quality control process outlined in X]_**.

- Datasets will be shared internally accompanied of                **_[which documentation? For example: a readme file outlining at least the methods followed for data collection, the quality control procedures that have been followed, and a data dictionary/documentation using the template X/documentation using the metadata template X]_**.

- Datasets will be shared internally by                   **_[how are the datasets going to be delivered? For example: by e-mail/by depositing them in Box/Google drive/external hard drive/shared drive/website]_**.

- When a member of the Project uses a dataset shared by another member of the team        **_[how will the use be notified? For example: a courtesy e-mail will be sent to the contact person/no notification will be needed at this stage/the member of the Project using the shared data will write his/her name in a log]_**.

- When a new version of a dataset is generated, it will be notified to the other members of the Project that may want to use the dataset by             **_[example: sending a general e-mail to the whole group/documenting in the documentation file the new version and sending individual e-mails to the members of the team that are known to be using the dataset]_**.

**_[Include other workflow details that will be useful if necessary. For example, there may be details in the data management plan that can be outlined or detailed here. For example, when will the datasets be made publicly available? Who will decide when to make the dataset available if there are several researchers working with them?]_**


### LAB NOTEBOOKS
Rationale: Scientific results are built on documented, measurements and reproducible protocols.  The primary goal of your lab notebook is to document what you did, in detail sufficient to understand and reproduce your results.  It should be a narrative that describes what you did, why you did it, your actual results, and how you interpret them.

- **If you didn’t document it, it didn’t happen.**
- **In two years, you’ll wish you had written more down.**  

Guidelines:

- Legible, in pen and kept in a bound notebook
- Enter information directly into the notebook
- Properly introduce and summarize each experiment
- Tape in any external results (graph printouts, etc.)
- Note where any electronic files associated with experiment are stored
- Include complete details of all first-time procedures, and cross-reference to page with full details for repeated procedures
- Include calculations
- Keep up with the table of contents.
- Date and number each page

### ELECTRONIC DATA
Rationale: Electronic data must be managed well to keep all files up to date, accessible and backed up.
- **Backup:** Files should be backed up as described below to cover everything from accidental deletion to destruction of the university.
- **Integrity:** Data files are the electronic equivalent of a lab notebook, meaning they should be tamper-resistant record of modifications
- **Collaboration:** Lab data should be readable and immediately available to future and current lab members.
- **Archival readability:** Data needs to be readable by labs that do not possess any proprietary software used by the lab.
- **Publication:** All published experimental data should be readily available to requesting labs.

#### BACKUP:
Back up info

#### FILE ORGANIZATION:
Lab material must be connectable to their context in the real world (lab notebook, instrument settings, etc.). Proper lab data management will ensure this is possible.

- The directory containing experimental output should have the following format:
YYYY-MM-DD_notebook-page_descriptive-name
- The raw experimental data should be exported into an appropriate non-proprietary, long-term file format.
- Each directory should have a clearly labeled summary file (image, text file/document, or graph). The summary file should be printed out and placed in the lab notebook.

### Section 4
### Roles and Responsibilities


Rationale: Data management takes time and effort. In order to not oversee any important data management action, it should be clear to all the members of the team who is responsible for each of them.


##### Role definitions: **_[adapt the definition of each of the roles for the Project. These roles are defined so that this document will not need to be adapted every time that there are changes within the Project team. These definitions should reflect as accurately as possible the roles in the project. For example, if the project will have Postdocs but not technicians, rename the Researcher role to Postdoc. For example, if there are going to be two kinds of students (field students and lab students) that will have different data management roles, these should be outlined here. For example, if the project is going to have a data manager, outline the role here.]_**


**Principal Investigator (PI):** leads the Project. It is usually designated by the funder. If there is no funder or the funder does not designate the principal investigator, it will be person providing leadership to the Project.

**Faculty Investigator:** they actively perform research on all or a part of the research Project. They may provide active mentorship to students.

**Team member:** they contribute to the scientific development or execution of a study in a substantive, measurable way (research/postdoctoral fellows, technicians, associates and consultants).

**Student:** member of the Project pursuing a degree. Undergraduate, master, PhD or others
